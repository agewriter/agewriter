# Code, Stories & Exploration

After 25 years of writing code, I've learned that the best projects are the ones that tell a story.

## What I'm About

I work across the full stack, but I'm more interested in what technology enables than the technology itself. These days, I'm exploring the intersections between:

- **Code** – Still my primary craft, but no longer my only one
- **Photography** – Capturing moments and stories, both in travel and everyday life
- **Gaming** – Particularly worlds that prioritize exploration and environmental storytelling
- **Storytelling** – The thread that connects everything else

## Current Projects

📝 [Written Ages](https://writtenages.com) – My personal space for photography, gaming thoughts, travel notes, and the occasional technical write-up

## Inspiration

If you've played the **Myst series**, you know that each Age preserves entire worlds within its pages. That's what I'm building here – a collection of moments, ideas, and explorations worth preserving.

## Let's Connect

Whether you're here for the code, the photography, or just curious about what I'm working on – welcome. There's more here than just lines of code.
